\section{Summary}
Personalized federated learning is a pseudo demand Personalization is not as complex as it needs to be. With so much data now, privacy data is not really needed, right

What is an application, a personalized recommendation system? There are many methods, such as user modeling, and even fine tuning an Excel model is enough If you are insist on it, you can call it "learning the data distribution of a large number of users",

Medical data silo? It seems possible that one hospital specialties in identifying heart tutors and another specialties in identifying brain tutors, but the recognition performance of a certain hospital has been improved through federation;

The road recognition of connected vehicles, rural vehicles, and urban vehicles have a significant difference It's better to learn it separately What kind of federation should we do? There should also be so called scenarios, but I don't have any ideas
